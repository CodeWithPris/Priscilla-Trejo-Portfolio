## About Me
I'm Priscilla N. Trejo, and I've had a deep passion for technology since childhood. My journey began with building Lego robots and exploring software, eventually leading me to create websites with tools like Weebly and Webs by the time I was 10.

In high school, I joined a robotics team, where I learned the basics of Python and honed my critical thinking and collaboration skills while building a 120 lb robot. After graduation, I continued to volunteer for the program and started learning various programming languages with the goal of mentoring a team in the future.

Now, I work full-time at a bookstore while self-educating to become a full-stack developer. I've created functional and aesthetically pleasing applications for small businesses and nonprofits, using my skills to help those who need a web presence. I'm also an active member of local web development groups like freeCodeCamp Indy, where I organize weekly virtual events and recently gave a talk about one of my projects and its tech stack.

When I'm not coding, you can find me immersed in a Brandon Sanderson novel, on a 10-mile hike with my partner, or working on digital art commissions.
